<div id=""introduction-section"">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this section, you will learn about competencies. By the end of the section, you should be able to define what competency is and its primary components.</p>
</div>
<div id=""instructions-section"">
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Read the following text about competencies:</p>
<p>Aspire  Ability <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">defines a competency as an area of capability. While the granularity of a competency is flexible (and the subject of much debate), our rule of thumb is that a competency generally manifests as a bullet-pointed item on a job description.</span></p>
<p>Competencies are the foundational elements of what allows a person to perform in a job or complete a task.</p>
<p>Competencies are made up of three components: Knowledge, Skill, and Ability. Information about Knowledge, Skill, and Ability, or (KSAs), can be found in the ""Define Knowledge, Skill, &amp; Ability"" learning activity.</p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>You should now be able to define what a competency is and where it fits, particularly in relation to doing a job.</p>
</div>
<div id=""call-to-action-section"">

<div id=""introduction-section"">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this section, you will learn about the difference between knowledge, skill, and ability and the differences between them.</p>
</div>
<div id=""instructions-section"">
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Read the following text about competencies:</p>
<p>Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities are what make up a competency. A competency can be defined at either the Knowledge (K), Skill (S), or Ability (A) level, so it is important to understand the distinct differences between each.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge -</strong>&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The foundational proficiency level for a competency. It includes the capacity to define, recognize, and describe the foundational principles and concepts related to a competency.</span></p>
<p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Example: I can explain that gravity is the invisible force that keeps us grounded.</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Skill -&nbsp;</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The capacity to apply and analyze the knowledge, tools, and processes related to a competency. Someone with skill is a proficient operator and implementer of a competency.</span></p>
<p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Example: I can perform simple calculations to determine the force with which gravity is pulling something to the earth.</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ability -</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Capacity to synthesize the knowledge and skill related to a competency. Someone with ability is a leading implementer, coach and mentor, and thought leader related to the Competency.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Example: I can teach others how to calculate how quickly a football will hit the ground after leaving my hand if I throw it upward at a 30&deg; angle at approximately 26 miles per hour.</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A competency can be required at any of these three levels, depending on the given context.</span></p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>You should now be able to explain the difference between knowledge, skill, and ability, and the implications of each in a competency-based context.</p>
</div>
<div id=""call-to-action-section"">
<h3>Call to Action</h3>
<p>Make a list of the competencies you make use of on a daily basis. Once you have created this list, go back through it and think of the context for each. Based on the context of each, indicate whether you feel you need the knowledge, skill, or ability level of each competency.</p>

<div id=""introduction-section"">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this section, you will learn about digital credentials. By the end of the section, you should be able to talk about what a digital credential is, and give a high-level overview of how they work.</p>
</div>
<div id=""instructions-section"">
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Read the following text about digital credentials:</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A digital credential is a standards-based, digital representation of an organization&rsquo;s competency assertion about an individual. Organizations can issue digital credentials at whatever level of granularity they see fit. However, Aspire  Ability strongly believes that digital credentials should have stand-alone value for individuals and employers when determining an individual&rsquo;s fit for a job. As such, digital credentials should generally be issued at the Competency and Competency Cluster levels.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Digital Credentials can be &ldquo;stacked&rdquo; to represent relevant competency groupings. Credential issuers determine the relevance of competency groupings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Verifiable claims are the building blocks of a lot of digital credentials today. Any credential following the Open Badges standard will utilize verifiable claims. Credentials with verifiable claims allow you to show proof of your competencies.</p>
<p><strong>Verifiable Claims -</strong> Verifiable claims are digital issuances with metadata that break down who issued the credential and what was done to achieve the credential.</p>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>You should now be able to explain what a digital credential is and how it is used. If you would like more information regarding digital credentials and the open badge standard, you can get it from one of the following locations.</p>

<p>In this section, you will learn about the new digital credential wallet known as the Learning &amp; Employment Record (LER). You should walk away from this section with the capacity to explain to someone what the LER is, how it is used, and how it works.</p>
</div>
<div id=""instructions-section"">
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Go to <a href=""https://lerhub.org/s/curators/ilr-utilities/GPRNsnPxFn3XE7Qbs"">LER Hub</a> and skim over the LER Overview information. Once you have done so, return to this page and watch the following video. Then go over the information below.</p>

  <div>
   <h4>What is the LER?</h4>
<p>The LER is the up-and-coming digital wallet for digital credentials. Such credentials can be but are not limited to open badges, transcripts, certifications, etc.</p> 
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>How to use it</h4>
<p>When using the Aspire  Ability Aspire platform, each time you demonstrate competence you will receive a digital credential. Each digital credential will automatically be uploaded to your LER. Eventually, you will be able to add any and all digital credentials you own to your LER.</p>
    <p>When you need to show someone proof of the competencies you possess, you can pick and choose which credentials you share with a third party and what you keep private.&nbsp;</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h4>How it works</h4>
<p>The LER is your personal credential wallet. You have complete control of how you share your credentials. The LER will follow you through life, allowing you to build your credential portfolio at every turn.</p>
  </div>
<h3>Review</h3>
<p>The Learning &amp; Employment Record is where all of your digital credentials will live. It gives you the ability to share the credentials you want with who you want when you want.</p>
</div>
<div id=""call-to-action-section"">
<h3>Call to Action</h3>
<p>Do a mental inventory of all your digital credentials, including transcripts, degrees, certifications, etc. Now think of how many different places you would have to go to in order to access all of your credentials. Wouldn't it be so much simpler if it all lived in one place? Enter the LER...</p>

<p>To access the learning activities within a specific competency, simply follow the steps below.</p>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Select the competency you would like to work on.</p>

<div id=""introduction-section"">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this section, you will review the distinctions between knowledge, skill, and ability and how they relate to competence. By the end of this section, you should be able to identify and describe generally the attributes of the competencies in your learning pathway at the knowledge, skill, and ability levels.</p>
</div>
<div id=""instructions-section"">
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Aspire competencies are broken into three different proficiency levels; Knowledge, Skill, and Ability. The attributes and definition for each can be found below.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge -</strong>&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The foundational proficiency level for a competency. It includes the capacity to define, recognize, and describe the foundational principles and concepts related to a competency.</span></p>
<p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Example: I can explain that gravity is the invisible force that keeps us grounded.</span></em></p>
<p><strong>Skill -&nbsp;</strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The capacity to apply and analyze the knowledge, tools, and processes related to a competency. Someone with skill is a proficient operator and implementer of a competency.</span></p>
<p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Example: I can perform simple calculations to determine the force with which gravity is pulling something to the earth.</span></em></p>
<p><strong>Ability - </strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Capacity to synthesize the knowledge and skill related to a competency. Someone with ability is a leading implementer, coach and mentor, and thought leader related to the Competency.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Example: I can teach others how to calculate how quickly a football will hit the ground after leaving my hand if I throw it upward at a 30&deg; angle at approximately 26 miles per hour.</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aspire utilizes authentic assessment techniques and best practices to evaluate your level of proficiency with each competency in your pathway. These assessments can take place in a variety of formats, ranging from rubric-based artifact uploads to rigorous multiple-choice evaluations.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This section breaks down the processes that take place when the minimum threshold for demonstrating competence at the K, S, or A level is not met.</p>
</div>
<div id=""instructions-section"">
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>The Aspire platform is designed and built around the idea of proving competence. That being said, it is irrelevant how many times an assessment needs to be taken in order to prove said competence.</p>
<p>In situations where competence is not proven, the learned simply reviews the assessment feedback, and returns to the learning activities specific to the necessary areas of focus for that competency.</p>
<p><em><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Example: Emma was trying to demonstrate her competence in data analytics, but didn't quite meet the needed criteria. In reviewing her assessment feedback, she gathered that she needed more help with calculating standard deviations of a data set. She went back into her learning pathway and reviewed the resources in the Skill learning activity for standard deviation.</span></em></p>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Review assessment feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Engage with the appropriate learning activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Re-assess and re-demonstrate.</p>

,,,,Utilizing Credentials,Evaluate & share the right credentials at the right time and in the right place.,Skill,,,Differentiating types of digital credentials,,Knowledge,"<h2>Differentiating Types of Digital Credentials</h2>
<div id=""introduction-section"">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This section will teach you how to parse varying types of digital credentials, particularly those most likely to show up in your Learning and Employment Record.</p>
</div>
<div id=""instructions-section"">
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>You are likely to encounter a hand full of different types of digital credentials throughout your career. Such credentials can be things like open badges, transcripts, and other artifacts. Below are some of the more common credentials that you are likely to encounter in your LER.</p>
<h4>Verifiable Claims</h4>
<p>Verifiable claims are a digital assertion of an event, status, or truth. Simply put, when a verifiable claim is issued, it creates a digital trail to the issuer and/or verifier. This allows individuals observing the contents of the credential to see why it was issued and if it came from a credible source.</p>
<p><em>Example: Aspire  Ability issued a verifiable claim as a credential that says Emma attended the mandatory sexual harassment seminar on June 30th, 2021 at her company. This credential shows the issuer as Aspire  Ability, the assertion as attendance of the seminar, and the date of issuance.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h4>Open Digital Badges</h4>
<p>Open badges are a type of digital credential, often containing verifiable claims, that make an assertion about an individual. In the context of the Aspire platform, badges are assertions of your competencies containing metadata about what you did to prove that competence.</p>
<p><em>Example: Aspire  Ability issued a badge to Emma for competence in HTML 5 at a skill level. The badge states the competency, as well as the knowledge, skill, or ability associated with that competency. It also details what Emma had to do to prove her competence in this area.</em></p>
