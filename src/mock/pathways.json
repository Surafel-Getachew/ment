Such credentials can be things like open badges, transcripts, and other artifacts. Below are some of the more common credentials that you are likely to encounter in your LER.</p>\n<h4>Verifiable Claims</h4>\n<p>Verifiable claims are a digital assertion of an event, status, or truth. Simply put, when a verifiable claim is issued, it creates a digital trail to the issuer and/or verifier. This allows individuals observing the contents of the credential to see why it was issued and if it came from a credible source.</p>\n<p><em>Example: Aspire  Ability issued a verifiable claim as a credential that says Emma attended the mandatory sexual harassment seminar on June 30th, 2021 at her company. This credential shows the issuer as Aspire  Ability, the assertion as attendance of the seminar, and the date of issuance.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<h4>Open Digital Badges</h4>\n<p>Open badges are a type of digital credential, often containing verifiable claims, that make an assertion about an individual. In the context of the Aspire platform, badges are assertions of your competencies containing metadata about what you did to prove that competence.</p>\n<p><em>Example: Aspire  Ability issued a badge to Emma for competence in HTML 5 at a skill level. The badge states the competency, as well as the knowledge, skill, or ability associated with that competency. It also details what Emma had to do to prove her competence in this area.</em></p>\n</div>\n<h3>Review</h3>\n<div id=\"review-section\">\n<p>You should now be able to differentiate between verifiable claims and digital badges, the two most common credentials you will receive on the Aspire platform.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"call-to-action-section\">\n<h3>Call to Action</h3>\n<p>If you already have a credential in your LER, take a look inside it and try to determine what kind of credential it is, based on what you have learned here.</p>\n</div>"
